    question: "How does the adaptive learning system work?",
    answer: "Our platform uses diagnostic assessments to identify each student's strengths and areas for improvement. The system then creates a personalized learning path that adapts in real-time as the student progresses, ensuring they're always challenged but never overwhelmed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can students join at any age or skill level?",
    answer: "Yes! Our bridging modules are specifically designed to help students catch up quickly if they join at a later stage. These modules cover foundational concepts in a condensed format, allowing students to integrate seamlessly into the regular curriculum."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the platform balance tech education with personal development?",
    answer: "Our curriculum thoughtfully integrates technical skills with personal development in each lesson. For example, a coding project might include elements of teamwork and communication, or a problem-solving exercise might incorporate mindfulness techniques to approach challenges creatively."
  },
  {
    question: "What role do teachers play in this platform?",
    answer: "Teachers act as facilitators rather than lecturers. Our platform handles content delivery and basic assessments, freeing teachers to provide targeted support, answer complex questions, and guide group discussions. This approach minimizes teacher workload while maximizing their impact."
  },
  {
    question: "How can schools integrate this platform with their existing curriculum?",
    answer: "Our platform is designed to be modular and flexible. Schools can implement it as a supplementary program, integrate specific modules into their existing curriculum, or adopt it as a comprehensive solution. Our team works with schools to create a customized implementation plan."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free trial available?",
    answer: "Yes! All our plans include a 14-day free trial with full access to features. No credit card is required to start exploring our platform."
