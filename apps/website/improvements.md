## Implementation Considerations

### Component Development Approach
- Use an Atomic Design methodology (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages)
- Start with the most reused components and move toward page-specific components
- Implement strong typing for all component props
- Ensure each component has appropriate test coverage

### Performance Goals
- Core Web Vitals targets:
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
  - First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- Initial load JavaScript bundle: < 150KB
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s on mid-range mobile devices

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
- Support for keyboard navigation throughout the site
- Screen reader compatibility for all content
- Color contrast ratios meeting AA standards
- Focus management for interactive components

### Browser and Device Support
- Modern browsers (latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- iOS 14+ and Android 9+
- Responsive design supporting 320px to 2560px widths
- Progressive enhancement approach for features

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Performance degradation:** Monitor bundle sizes and runtime performance throughout development
- **Browser compatibility issues:** Implement cross-browser testing early in component development
- **Accessibility regressions:** Include accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep:** Maintain clear boundaries for each phase and track scope changes
- **Timeline slippage:** Build buffer time into each phase and prioritize core functionality
- **Resource constraints:** Identify critical path components and ensure appropriate resourcing

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Performance scores (Core Web Vitals)
- Code quality metrics (test coverage, complexity)
- Accessibility compliance percentage

### Business Metrics
- Conversion rate improvements
- User engagement metrics (time on site, pages per session)
- Bounce rate reduction
- Feature discovery increase

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to the comprehensive redesign of the Supernova LMS website. The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing while maintaining a cohesive vision for the final product.
